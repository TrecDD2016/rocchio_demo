 The Republican National Convention 2016, which runs Monday through Thursday, will feature a traditional lineup of politicians, including Gov. Chris Christie, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other prominent Republican elected officials.

The quadrennial gathering also will feature speakers who usually don't appear at a convention podium, including Willie Robertson, star of the cable-TV program "Duck Dynasty." 

"We will not have the traditional wall-to-wall speakers from Washington," Paul Manafort, campaign chairman for presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, told reporters here Sunday. "The goal for the Trump campaign for this convention is to help the American people understand more about Donald Trump the man, not just the candidate on the campaign trail."
